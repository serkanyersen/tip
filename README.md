Written in React, Semantic UI and Browserify as an exercise

## Demo
http://labs.serkan.io/tip

## To Develop
- Checkout the library and go in to the directory
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` and you'll be able to access the app on `http://localhost:8000`

## To Serve
Do the same as steps as development but instead of `grunt server` run `grunt build`
You can now serve the application using your own server.

## Screenshot
Semantic UI is kinda handsome.
